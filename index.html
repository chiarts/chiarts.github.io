                        FY12-FY14 TRIENNIALREPORT                 Scholar-Artist skol-er - ahr-tist NOUN a student who embodies the value of learning as both a creative and academic enterprise and strives always to engage with and expand the arts and minds of Chicago and beyond.                 A MESSAGE FROM THE DIRECTOR After a group of arts and education leaders identified the need for a public high school for the arts in Chicago and began building the framework to make this dream a reality ChiArts Board of Directors was formed with its founding members in 2007. Shortly after in 2008 I was hired on as ChiArts first and only employee. With our shared passion for providing Chicagos youth access to a tuition- free education in the arts we quickly formed a family-like bond. Soon after our small family began to grow. First we welcomed Founding Principal and Chief Academic Officer Terri Milsap followed by key support and administrative staff. By the spring of 2009 we had four arts department heads academic and arts instructors a few more board members and a growing community of supporters. And finally on September 8 of that same year ChiArts opened its doors for the first time to 150 promising freshmen students. Throughout the next four years I watched in amazement as my new family continued to grow. Each year 150 more young artists joined us to create a full student body  freshmen through seniors  by the fall of 2012. As we grew our students transformed into scholar-artists feeding their ambition with hours of rigorous arts training private lessons after-school rehearsals college-preparatory academic courses exhibitions homework gigs college applications auditions and preparation for the future ahead. In just a few short years  with the help of our dedicated staff supporters Board of Directors and of course our students  we became a nationally recognized art school. During the past few years the organization also went through many changes and spurts of growth. After living at two different temporary locations in the Bronzeville neighborhood ChiArts finally moved into a permanent home in the West Town neighborhood for the start of the 2014-15 school year. At the same time we also introduced a fifth conservatory for Creative Writing to reach an even broader scope of talented young artists. In the beginning stages of ChiArts journey I talked a lot about a dream and a promise for Chicago students. I am so happy to share how weve grown and fulfilled that promise for more than 750 students all of whom are and always will be part of the ChiArts family. Thank you to everyone who has been involved in making ChiArts what it is today. I cant wait to see what the next five years hold. Sincerely Jos Ochoa Executive  Artistic Director                 As you will see in the following pages our first two classes of alumni  our pioneers and school ambassadors  have aready begun to fulfill this vision. Whether they are dancing in a professionalcompanyinDresdenGermanystudyingactingand creativewritingonafour-yearfull-tuitionscholarshipatOberlin College in Ohio majoring in civil engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison studying Jazz Performance at the University of the Pacific as a Brubeck Fellow or pursuing their love of photography at Rocky Mountain College of Art  Design they are continuing their journey as our future artists and citizens. It is with tremendous gratitude that we recognize those that have supported us philanthropically in this report. While Chicago Public Schools provides us a home and defrays the majority of academic costs the arts instruction training and enrichment is privately underwritten by the individuals corporations and foundations named here. I hope you are as proud as I am of all that has been achieved by our students in the first five years and especially our first two graduating classes. Their accomplishments beyond ChiArts are proof of the value of your investment. Every gift has been a testament to the importance of ChiArts to our public school students the future of our city and the future of our arts community. Gratefully Marge Collens Board Chair A MESSAGE FROM THE BOARD CHAIR I have watched The Chicago High School for the Arts transform from an exciting startup high school to an organization that is known and respected in the national arts education community. ChiArts is still Chicagos only public high school to offer college- preparatory academic studies and an intensive pre-professional program in creative writing dance music theatre and visual arts. It has been my honor to be part of the effort to make this level of arts training accessible and tuition-free to students in the city of Chicago. ChiArts was conceived nearly ten years ago by a group of arts and education leaders called the Diversity Working Group. They envisioned an arts high school that will play a pivotal role in building the pipeline of talented young artists who are representative of the rich cultural and ethnic diversity of Chicago and who will become the arts practitioners and patrons of the future in Chicago and beyond. Over the next few years ChiArts became a labor of love for me and so many who believed in the importance of ChiArts for our city.                 The school will be an exemplary public high school a model in providing a rigorous and exhilarating teaching and learning environment. ChiArts will be a leader in artistic and academic innovation and will collaborate with and provide access to the world-class artistic and intellectual resources of Chicagos arts and higher education institutions. Our Mission FOR OUR SCHOOL FOR OUR STUDENTS Our Vision The mission of The Chicago High School for the Arts ChiArts  is to provide artistically gifted diverse Chicago high school students intensive pre-professional training in the arts combined with a comprehensive college preparatory curriculum. ChiArts vision is to inspire and develop the artistic academic and leadership abilities of its diverse students. The high school will provide its students with the experiences and skills to help them reach their full potential as both artists and active citizens and instill in them a lifelong commitment to excellence and innovation in the arts as artists educators or civic leaders. HUMILITY CREATIVITY COMMUNITY INTEGRITY BALANCE PERSEVERANCE ChiArts Scholar- Artists reflect create connect and express the core values of while pursuing their academic and artistic interests.                 The Elizabeth Morse Charitable Trust and Elizabeth Morse Genius Charitable Trust convene the Diversity Working Group DWG to discuss the issue of diversity within mid-to-large-sized arts organizations in Chicago. 2004 In August The DWG published A Vision for a Fine and Performing Arts High School in Chicago reporting the results of their study of diversity within Chicago arts institutions. Their findings lead them to pursue the idea of a public arts high school to provide a comprehen- sive learning environment with superior training at the high school level. The DWG hosts a Kick-Off Breakfast in October with 115 leaders from across the city in attendance. Six speakers repre- senting key segments of the Chicago arts education and philanthrophic community present why a public arts high school is needed and why they are pledging their support. ChiArts is approved by the Chicago Board of Education to open as a contract school through the Renaissance 2010 initiative. 2006 2006 2007 i n t h e A DEC                 On September 8 ChiArts opens its doors for the first time to 150 Fresh- man students. In August after nearly five months of renova- tions ChiArts moves into its permanent facility in Chicagos West Town community. 2009 2012 2014 2013 On June 7 ChiArts graduated 94 of its first senior class at the Harris Theater for Music and Dance with Herbie Hancock as the keynote speaker. In September the school reaches full enrollment with freshman through senior classes. m a k i n g CADE                 Student Demographics 2013-14 enrollment numbers African-American 50 HispanicLatino 22 White 14 Multi- Racial 12 AsianPacific Islander 2 A reflection of Chicago ChiArts students come from all 50 of Chicagos wards and more than 180 public and private elementary schools.

I believe that teenage years are most influential to your future and I am thankful that I had ChiArts to believe in my artistry as a teenager even when I doubted myself.  Breanna Class of 2014 I think ChiArts has allowed me to find myself and be comfortable with expression. The teachers faculty and staff have introduced me to a world of learning that I love. ChiArts is a school that helps design strong artists and scholars not one or the other. Ryan Class of 2013 If you are dedicated and bound to your art and want to make a living from it you should attend a school as intense as ChiArts. It prepares you very well for college and pushes you to the limit in all aspects of being a scholar-artist and human being.
