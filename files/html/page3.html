A MESSAGE FROM THE DIRECTOR After a group of arts and education leaders identified the need for a public high school for the arts in Chicago and began building the framework to make this dream a reality ChiArts Board of Directors was formed with its founding members in 2007. Shortly after in 2008 I was hired on as ChiArts first and only employee. With our shared passion for providing Chicagos youth access to a tuition- free education in the arts we quickly formed a family-like bond. Soon after our small family began to grow. First we welcomed Founding Principal and Chief Academic Officer Terri Milsap followed by key support and administrative staff. By the spring of 2009 we had four arts department heads academic and arts instructors a few more board members and a growing community of supporters. And finally on September 8 of that same year ChiArts opened its doors for the first time to 150 promising freshmen students. Throughout the next four years I watched in amazement as my new family continued to grow. Each year 150 more young artists joined us to create a full student body  freshmen through seniors  by the fall of 2012. As we grew our students transformed into scholar-artists feeding their ambition with hours of rigorous arts training private lessons after-school rehearsals college-preparatory academic courses exhibitions homework gigs college applications auditions and preparation for the future ahead. In just a few short years  with the help of our dedicated staff supporters Board of Directors and of course our students  we became a nationally recognized art school. During the past few years the organization also went through many changes and spurts of growth. After living at two different temporary locations in the Bronzeville neighborhood ChiArts finally moved into a permanent home in the West Town neighborhood for the start of the 2014-15 school year. At the same time we also introduced a fifth conservatory for Creative Writing to reach an even broader scope of talented young artists. In the beginning stages of ChiArts journey I talked a lot about a dream and a promise for Chicago students. I am so happy to share how weve grown and fulfilled that promise for more than 750 students all of whom are and always will be part of the ChiArts family. Thank you to everyone who has been involved in making ChiArts what it is today. I cant wait to see what the next five years hold. Sincerely Jos Ochoa Executive  Artistic Director
