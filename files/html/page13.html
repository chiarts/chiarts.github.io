VISUALARTS The Visual Arts Conservatory at ChiArts begins with foundational instruction including an emphasis upon essential art making skills and understandings and progresses toward more complex concepts including critical analysis of visual culture and the fostering of independent work. The program challenges and empowers students to develop their own aesthetic as each matures into an innovative artist and critical thinker.
