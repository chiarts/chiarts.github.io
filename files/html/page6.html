The Elizabeth Morse Charitable Trust and Elizabeth Morse Genius Charitable Trust convene the Diversity Working Group DWG to discuss the issue of diversity within mid-to-large-sized arts organizations in Chicago. 2004 In August The DWG published A Vision for a Fine and Performing Arts High School in Chicago reporting the results of their study of diversity within Chicago arts institutions. Their findings lead them to pursue the idea of a public arts high school to provide a comprehen- sive learning environment with superior training at the high school level. The DWG hosts a Kick-Off Breakfast in October with 115 leaders from across the city in attendance. Six speakers repre- senting key segments of the Chicago arts education and philanthrophic community present why a public arts high school is needed and why they are pledging their support. ChiArts is approved by the Chicago Board of Education to open as a contract school through the Renaissance 2010 initiative. 2006 2006 2007 i n t h e A DEC
