I believe that teenage years are most influential to your future and I am thankful that I had ChiArts to believe in my artistry as a teenager even when I doubted myself.  Breanna Class of 2014 I think ChiArts has allowed me to find myself and be comfortable with expression. The teachers faculty and staff have introduced me to a world of learning that I love. ChiArts is a school that helps design strong artists and scholars not one or the other. Ryan Class of 2013 If you are dedicated and bound to your art and want to make a living from it you should attend a school as intense as ChiArts. It prepares you very well for college and pushes you to the limit in all aspects of being a scholar-artist and human being.  Eyeri Class of 2013 Words cant explain how well I have been prepared for a career in the arts. I feel like I can just walk into my career today and be ready and just as great as someone with a degree.
