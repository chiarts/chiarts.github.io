As you will see in the following pages our first two classes of alumni  our pioneers and school ambassadors  have aready begun to fulfill this vision. Whether they are dancing in a professionalcompanyinDresdenGermanystudyingactingand creativewritingonafour-yearfull-tuitionscholarshipatOberlin College in Ohio majoring in civil engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison studying Jazz Performance at the University of the Pacific as a Brubeck Fellow or pursuing their love of photography at Rocky Mountain College of Art  Design they are continuing their journey as our future artists and citizens. It is with tremendous gratitude that we recognize those that have supported us philanthropically in this report. While Chicago Public Schools provides us a home and defrays the majority of academic costs the arts instruction training and enrichment is privately underwritten by the individuals corporations and foundations named here. I hope you are as proud as I am of all that has been achieved by our students in the first five years and especially our first two graduating classes. Their accomplishments beyond ChiArts are proof of the value of your investment. Every gift has been a testament to the importance of ChiArts to our public school students the future of our city and the future of our arts community. Gratefully Marge Collens Board Chair A MESSAGE FROM THE BOARD CHAIR I have watched The Chicago High School for the Arts transform from an exciting startup high school to an organization that is known and respected in the national arts education community. ChiArts is still Chicagos only public high school to offer college- preparatory academic studies and an intensive pre-professional program in creative writing dance music theatre and visual arts. It has been my honor to be part of the effort to make this level of arts training accessible and tuition-free to students in the city of Chicago. ChiArts was conceived nearly ten years ago by a group of arts and education leaders called the Diversity Working Group. They envisioned an arts high school that will play a pivotal role in building the pipeline of talented young artists who are representative of the rich cultural and ethnic diversity of Chicago and who will become the arts practitioners and patrons of the future in Chicago and beyond. Over the next few years ChiArts became a labor of love for me and so many who believed in the importance of ChiArts for our city.
